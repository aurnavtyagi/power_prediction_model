## 🔬 1. Integration of Deep Learning Models (LSTM)

We are actively exploring the use of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks for improving long-range forecasting accuracy.

### Why LSTM?
- LSTMs are capable of learning **long-term dependencies** and **sequential patterns** in time-series data.
- Unlike tree-based models, LSTMs can understand trends, seasonality, and complex temporal dynamics.

### Current Challenge
> ⚠️ We currently have **only 4 years of historical data**, which is relatively limited for training robust deep learning models.

Due to the data limitation:
- Model overfitting is a concern
- Seasonality and anomaly patterns are harder to generalize
- Fine-tuning and validation are more difficult

To overcome this, we are:
- Investigating **data augmentation techniques**
- Evaluating **feature engineering** and dimensionality reduction to improve signal quality

## 📱 2. Application Development

To improve accessibility and usability, we are also working on developing a **lightweight web application** or **dashboard** to:

- ✅ Upload and preprocess generation data
- ✅ Select forecasting models (mean-based, stacked, future LSTM)
- ✅ Visualize predicted vs actual performance interactively
- ✅ Download forecasted results in CSV format

### Goals for the App:
- Platform-independent (via **Streamlit** or **Flask**)
- User-friendly interface for dam operators or analysts
- Fast and efficient even on low-resource devices
